\title{A function to import fusion data detected by different fusion finders}
\description{A function to import in a list fusions data detected by bellerophontes, defuse, fusionfinder, fusionhunter, mapsplice, tophat-fusion, fusionmap, chimerascan, STAR, Rsubread.
In the case of chimerascan and STAR output it is possible to load the data applying a filter on the minimal number of reads supporting a specific fusion. Both chimerascan and star accept data generated using human hg19 and mouse mm9 reference. Star import function has a parallel option using BiocParallel package.             
}
\usage{importFusionData(format, filename, ...)}
\arguments{
  \item{format}{bellerophontes, defuse, fusionfinder, fusionhunter, mapsplice, tophat-fusion, fusionmap, chimerascan, star, rsubread. Format allows to select the data structure to be imported}
  \item{filename}{The file generated by one of the fusion finders defined in format}
  \item{...}{Additional parameters:
   in case of rsubread min.distance, which is set to 700000 as default, indicates the minimal distance to consider a fusion within the same chromosome
   in case of rsubread, chimerascan and STAR min.support, which is set to 10 as default, indicates the minimal number of reads supporting a specific fusion
   in case of chimerascan, STAR, Rsubread, fusionmap org, which can be hs or mm, indicates the organism to be used for annotation.}
   in case of STAR and Rsubread the upload can be parallelized using parallel=TRUE
